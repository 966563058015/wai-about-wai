## Measures to support accessibility

W3C’s Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) takes the following measures to ensure accessibility of the WAI Website:

-   Include accessibility as part of our mission statement.
-   Include accessibility throughout our internal policies.
-   Integrate accessibility into our procurement practices.

## Conformance status

The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) defines requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA. WAI Website is fully conformant with WCAG 2.1 level AA. Fully conformant means that the content fully conforms to the accessibility standard without any exceptions.

### Additional accessibility considerations

This accessibility statement mainly covers current documents and resources, published in the current WAI design. Older documents and resources, usually available for archival, might only comply with earlier versions of the WCAG standard.
