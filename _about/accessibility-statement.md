## Measures to support accessibility

Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) takes the following measures to ensure accessibility of the WAI website:

-  Include WCAG 2.1 AA conformance as a requirement for all web content. Consider conforming to AAA for most context.
-  Assign clear accessibility targets and responsibilities.
-  Ensure content authors have accessibility knowledge and skills.
-  Include accessibility as part of our mission statement.
-  Include accessibility throughout our internal policies.
-  Employ people with disabilities.
-  Usability test with participants with disabilities.

## Conformance status

The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) defines requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA. Fully conformant means that the content fully conforms to the accessibility standard without any exceptions.

<strong>WAI website content posted since May 2018 is fully conformant with WCAG 2.1 Level AA.</strong> Most content is also conformant with Level AAA.

Older content is conformant with earlier versions of WCAG, for example, WCAG 2.0. Most of the older content is archived and will not be updated.

## Feedback

We welcome your feedback on the accessibility of the WAI website. Please let us know if you encounter accessibility barriers on the WAI website:

-   E-mail: <a href="mailto:wai@w3.org?subject=%5BWebsite%20Conformance%5D%20">wai@w3.org</a>
-   Phone numbers and physical addresses are in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/contacting/#locations-and-address">"Locations and Addresses" section of the Contacting WAI page</a>.

We try to respond to feedback within 5 business days.

## Compatibility with browsers and assistive technology

The WAI website is designed to be compatible with assistive technologies working with the following browsers:

-   Last two versions of major browsers
-   Internet Explorer 10

In Internet Explorer 10 and in older browsers, some aspects of the website may not display optimally. The website is not designed for Internet Explorer 9 and earlier versions.

## Technical specifications

The WAI website relies on the following technologies to work with the particular combination of web browser and any assistive technologies or plugins installed on your computer. These technologies are "relied upon" for conformance with WCAG 2.1:

-   HTML
-   WAI-ARIA
-   CSS
-   SVG

These technologies are used to improve the user experience and accessibility:

-   JavaScript


## Limitations and alternatives

Currently access to YouTube is required to view some videos on the WAI website. We are looking into providing those in an alternative method.

The WAI website links to GitHub for providing input on resources and documents in development. As an alternative, input can be provided by e-mail.

## Assessment approach

WAI assessed the accessibility of the WAI website by self-evaluation.

## Formal Complaints

We try to respond to accessibility feedback within 5 business days. If you are not satisfied with our response, you can escalate a complaint to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) senior management via e-mail to: <a href="mailto: site-policy@w3.org">site-policy@w3.org</a>.

## Formal approval of this accessibility statement

This Accessibility Statement is approved by Judy Brewer, WAI Director, and Shawn Lawton Henry, WAI Outreach Coordinator.
