## Measures to support accessibility

Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) takes the following measures to ensure accessibility of the WAI website:

-  Include accessibility as a requirement for all web content.
-  Assign clear accessibility targets and responsibilities.
-  Ensure content authors have accessibility knowledge and skills.
-  Include accessibility as part of our mission statement.
-  Include accessibility throughout our internal policies.
-  Employ people with disabilities.
-  Usability test with participants with disabilities.

## Conformance status

The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) defines requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA. Fully conformant means that the content fully conforms to the accessibility standard without any exceptions.

<strong>WAI website content posted since May 2018 is fully conformant with WCAG 2.1 Level AA.</strong> Most content is also conformant with Level AAA.

Older content is conformant with earlier versions of WCAG. Most of the older content is archived and will not be updated.

## Compatibility with browsers and assistive technology

The WAI website is designed to be compatible with assistive technologies working with the following browsers:

-   Last two versions of major browsers
-   Internet Explorer 10

In Internet Explorer 10 and in older browsers, some aspects of the user interface are simplified.  [[@@ee: trying for clearer than "low fidelity" â€“how's that?]]

The WAI website is not compatible with:

-   Internet Explorer 9 and earlier versions

[[@@ee: not at all? or ?]]

## Technical specifications

Accessibility of WAI website relies on the following technologies to work with the particular combination of web browser and any assistive technologies or plugins installed on your computer:

-   HTML
-   WAI-ARIA
-   CSS
-   Javascript
-   SVG

These technologies are "relied upon" for conformance with WCAG 2.1.

[[@@ee: are all of those actually *replied upon* for conformance, or are some just nice to have?]]

## Limitations and alternatives

Currently access to YouTube is required to view some videos. We are looking into providing those in an alternative method. [@@ee: is it true that YouTube is required?]] 

The WAI website links to GitHub for providing input on resources and documents in development. As an alternative, input can be provided by e-mail.

## Assessment approach

WAI assessed the accessibility of the WAI website by self-evaluation.

## Formal approval of this accessibility statement

This Accessibility Statement is approved by WAI Staff: Judy Brewer, Shawn Lawton Henry, Eric Eggert, and Shadi Abou-Zahra.
