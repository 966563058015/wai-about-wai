## Background

This Open Meeting is held as part of the project efforts to engage with the broader community throughout the development of the project deliverables, to help ensure consensus and uptake by European and international stakeholders. Participants will learn about the objectives and deliverables of the project, interim project results, and about potential opportunities for participation and collaboration.
