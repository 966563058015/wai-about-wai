## Project Results
{:#results}

Current project results include:

**[Developing an Accessibility Statement {% include_cached different.html %}](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/)**
:  Includes guidance on how to develop accessibility statements for websites, mobile applications, and other digital content, as well as a free and open source accessibility statements generator tool. More information in the blog post [How to Create Accessibility Statements {% include_cached different.html %}](https://www.w3.org/blog/2018/11/how-to-create-accessibility-statements/). This is the result of project deliverable D3.1, which was developed through the [W3C Education and Outreach Working Group (EOWG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/groups/eowg/).

**[Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules {% include_cached different.html %}](https://auto-wcag.github.io/auto-wcag/pages/rules.html)**
:  Includes writing, reviewing, implementing, and validating "Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules". About 30 rules were developed during the first project year, with another 25 to follow this year. This is the result of project deliverables D1.1, D1.2, and D1.3, which are continually developed through the [W3C Auto-WCAG Community Group](https://auto-wcag.github.io/auto-wcag/).

**[Open Format for Accessibility Test Results {% include_cached different.html %}](https://github.com/w3c/earl)**
:  Includes the definition of an open data format to express accessibility test results. It is a [JSON-LD 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/) serialization of the [EARL 1.0 Schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/), and is implemented by the open source [Alfa](https://github.com/siteimprove/alfa) and [aXe Core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-reporter-earl) accessibility testing engines. This is the result of project deliverable D2.1.

## Project Deliverables
{:#deliverables}

Technical project deliverables include:

-   **Development of Test Rules**
    -   **D1.1: Development of Test Rules** — development of accessibility conformance test rules according to the [ACT Rules Format 1.0 {% include_cached different.html %}](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/) standard from W3C.
    -   **D1.2: Implementation of Test Rules** — implementation of the test rules developed by the project in at least two open source testing engines.
    -   **D1.3: Validation of Test Rules** — validate and refine test rules developed by the project, to meet the requirements for authoritative [ACT Rules {% include_cached different.html %}](https://auto-wcag.github.io/auto-wcag/pages/rules.html).
-   **Deployment of Test Rules**
    -   **D2.1: Open Format for Test Results** — develop open format built on [Evaluation and Report Language (EARL) {% include_cached different.html %}](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/earl) and [Test Case Description Language (TCDL) {% include_cached different.html %}](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tests/).
    -   **D2.2: Applying to Portuguese Observatory** — applying the test rules and tooling developed by the project in the [Portuguese national observatory {% include_cached different.html %}](http://accessmonitor.acessibilidade.gov.pt/observatorio/).
    -   **D2.3: Applying to Norwegian Observatory** — applying the test rules and tooling developed by the project in the [Norwegian national observatory {% include_cached different.html %}](https://uu.difi.no/om-oss/english).
-   **Integration of Test Rules**
    -   **D3.1: Accessibility Statement Generator** — open source tool, to assist help [create accessibility statements {% include_cached different.html %}](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/).
    -   **D3.2: Extended Accessibility Report Tool** — extending the [WCAG-EM Report Tool {% include_cached different.html %}](https://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/report-tool/) with functionality to import fully- and semi-automated test results.
    -   **D3.3: Large-Scale Test Data Browser** — open source prototype, based on existing standards and tools, to browse large amounts of accessibility test results.

These deliverables are complemented by project management, dissemination, and engagement efforts.

## About the Project
{:#about}

WAI-Tools, Advanced Decision Support Tools for Scalable Web Accessibility Assessments, is an Innovation Action project, co-funded by the European Commission (EC) under the Horizon 2020 program (Grant Agreement 780057). The project started on 1 November 2017 for a duration of three years. WAI-Tools drives web accessibility evaluation and repair through:

-   Building on the on-going W3C efforts on [WCAG Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT)](http://www.w3.org/wai/gl/task-forces/conformance-testing/);
-   Ensuring consistent accuracy across automated, semi-automated, and manual testing;
-   Pursuing leading edge technologies testing, including dynamic and mobile applications;
-   Leveraging the existing market of commercial, free, and open source evaluation tools;
-   Demonstrating large-scale accessibility monitoring built on open standards and tools.

WAI-Tools achieves this by carrying out key efforts in the vendor-neutral environment of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). WAI-Tools draws together key expertise from industry, public bodies, and research to develop common understanding of web accessibility requirements.
