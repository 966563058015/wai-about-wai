## Invitation
{:#invitation}

The Web Accessibility Initiative - Communities of Practice ([WAI-CooP](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/projects/wai-coop/)) Project invites researchers, practitioners, and users with disabilities to participate in an international online symposium exploring research challenges and opportunities in digital accessibility.

- Symposium date: **10 November 2021**
- Paper submission date: **6 October 2021**

Accepted contributions will be made available on the symposium page and will be open to discussion prior to the symposium<!--// through the WAI-CooP open forum [link?] //-->. Authors of accepted contributions will be invited to participate as panelists in the symposium. Attendance to the symposium is open to anyone interested.

## Introduction
{:#introduction}

This online symposium brings together researchers, practitioners (academia, industry, government, consulting) and users with disabilities, to explore the current state-of-the-art in accessibility research, development, and practice to uncover pressing topics for future research and development.

Another goal of this symposium is to explore potential gaps between the topics discussed by researchers and practitioners. By increasing awareness to the challenges faced by all communities, collaborations could emerge and improve the current state of accessibility research and practice.

We invite position papers discussing these topics using real-life settings and raising current issues and needs for discussion. After the symposium, the WAI-CooP project will publish a report, consolidating the discussions and findings.
