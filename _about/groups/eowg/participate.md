## Becoming an Active Participant {#participant}

Participant status requires a commitment on your behalf to support the
work of the group. The [EOWG
Charter](http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/2015/charter6-2015-09#participation)
explains expectations of active participants:

> Effective participation to Education and Outreach Working Group is expected to consume a **minimum of 4 hours per week for each participant**, and a minimum of 8 hours per week for editors. Active participants are expected to contribute to the development of deliverables by:
>
> -   attending most meetings of the Working Group that are in reasonable working hours in their timezone.
> -   being familiar with the relevant documents of the Working Group, including minutes of past meetings.
> -   commenting on open issues.
> -   responding to e-mails sent to the EOWG mailing list.
> -   completing [EOWG surveys/questionnaires](http://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/35532/all) in a timely manner.
>
> With permission of the Chairs, an individual may contribute only to a
> specific deliverable, and thus only needs to meet the participation
> expectations related to that deliverable.

Note that EOWG is a public Working Group and participation in it does not give you access to information that is W3C Member-confidential.

1.  Learn about participating in EOWG.

    -   Read the [EOWG Charter](/WAI/EO/2015/charter6-2015-09). Understand the [Participation expectations](https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/2015/charter6-2015-09#participation), including a minimum of 4 hours per week.

    -   Read [EOWG Participation Info](https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/EOWG_Participation_Info).

    -   Read the [invited expert and collaborators agreement](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/collaborators-agreement).

2.  Explain your interest in contributing to EOWG work in an e-mail to EOWG Co-Chairs Sharron and Brent, and W3C Staff Contact Shawn, at [team-eowg-chairs@w3.org](mailto:team-eowg-chairs@w3.org?subject=EOWG%20Contribution).

3.  Demonstrate your understanding of EOWG and your contributions by commenting on open issues and documents-in-progress through GitHub *(strongly preferred)* or the <wai-eo-editors@w3.org> mailing list.

    -   Subscribe to the EOWG mailing list, per [list instructions above](#mail).

    -   Watch the Work for this Week and the EOWG mailing list for open issues and documents-in-progress.

        -   GitHub - You can raise issues; fork and edit, and submit pull requests; etc.

        -   Surveys - You can see the results of surveys, although not access the surveys themselves. To see the results, add "/results" to the end of the URL.

        -   Wiki pages - You can see them, but not edit them.

    -   If you have questions, e-mail [team-eowg-chairs@w3.org](mailto:team-eowg-chairs@w3.org?subject=EOWG%20participation).

4.  After you are comfortable that you understand EOWG and have demonstrated contributions, e-mail [team-eowg-chairs@w3.org](mailto:team-eowg-chairs@w3.org?subject=EOWG%20participation) with ideas on how you can contribute more as an active EOWG participant. We will probably schedule a time to talk via phone.

5.  After you receive an invitation from the Chairs and Staff Contact (probably via phone, maybe via e-mail), complete the [W3C Invited Expert Application](https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/1/ieapp/).
