The mission of the Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group (APA
WG) is to ensure W3C specifications provide support for accessibility to
people with disabilities. The group advances this mission through review
of W3C specifications, development of technical support materials,
collaboration with other Working Groups, and coordination of harmonized
accessibility strategies within W3C.

## Announcements

*2017-12-07* - **Cognitive Accessibility Roadmap and Gap Analysis First
Public Working Draft**: The [Cognitive and Learning Disabilities
Accessibility Task Force](https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/)
has published a first public Working Draft of [Cognitive Accessibility
Roadmap and Gap
Analysis](https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/WD-coga-gap-analysis-20171207/). It
explores user needs for people with cognitive or learning disabilities
and identifies where additional web content authoring guidance is needed
to help authors meet these needs. This information is important to new
guidance being added to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1. Please
comment by **16 January 2018**.

## Current Work

The APA WG is engaged on the following work:

-   Publications: The Working Group maintains a comprehensive list of
    [publications and status](deliverables), which include:
    -   Media Accessibility User Requirements,
    -   Payment Accessibility User Requirements,
    -   Web Technology Accessibility Guidelines plus checklist, and
    -   Inaccessibility of CAPTCHA.
-   Specification reviews: input is solicited on the [WAI Interest Group
    mailing list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/), and
    comments are copied to the [wai-xtech mailing
    list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/wai-xtech/).
-   Community groups: the Working Group maintains a [list of community
    groups to
    track](https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/wiki/Spec_Review/Community_Groups).
-   Developing support tools:
    -   Group Coordination Matrix: tracks the accessibility interest APA
        has in the specifications produced by other W3C Working Groups,
        as well as people with known relevant expertise.
    -   Specification Review Tracker: trackes feedback the APA has sent
        to other Working Groups, to ensure that comments are resolved
        and for history when later comments are filed.

The [APA Project Plan](project) details intended timeline and milestones
for this work.
