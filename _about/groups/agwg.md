The mission of the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group is to develop
guidelines to make Web content accessible for people with disabilities
and to develop and maintain implementation support materials for the Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines.

## Announcements

*2017-12-07* - **Cognitive Accessibility Roadmap and Gap Analysis First
Public Working Draft**: The [Cognitive and Learning Disabilities
Accessibility Task Force](https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/)
has published a first public Working Draft of [Cognitive Accessibility
Roadmap and Gap
Analysis](https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/WD-coga-gap-analysis-20171207/). It
explores user needs for people with cognitive or learning disabilities
and identifies where additional web content authoring guidance is needed
to help authors meet these needs. This information is important to new
guidance being added to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1. Please
comment by **16 January 2018**.

## Current Work

The Working Group maintains a comprehensive list of
[publications](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/deliverables), which include:

-   WCAG 2.1,
-   Understanding WCAG 2.0,
-   WCAG 2.0 Techniques
-   Errata for WCAG 2.0, and
-   Accessibility Guidelines 3.0 ("Silver").

The [Project Plan](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/project) details intended timeline and milestones for
this work. A [list of
publications](https://www.w3.org/TR/tr-groups-all#tr_Web_Content_Accessibility_Guidelines_Working_Group)
on the W3C Technical Reports page includes completed deliverables that
are no longer worked on by the Working Group.

## Task Forces

The AG WG uses [task forces](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces) to focus work on specific
projects. Current task forces include:

-   [Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Task
    Force](task-forces/conformance-testing/): develop a framework and
    repository of test rules, to promote a unified interpretation of
    WCAG 2.0 among different web accessibility test tools;
-   [Cognitive Accessibility Task
    Force](http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/): jointly
    operated with the Accessible Platform Architectures WG to improve
    Web accessibility for people with cognitive and learning
    disabilities;
-   [Low Vision Accessibility Task Force](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/low-vision-a11y-tf/): identify
    issues and specify solutions to web accessibility issues specific to
    users with low vision;
-   [Mobile Accessibility Task Force](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/mobile-a11y-tf/): produce
    techniques, understanding and guidance documents as well as updates
    to existing related W3C / WAI material that addresses the mobile
    space;
-   [Silver Task Force](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/silver/): perform preliminary
    development of a new version of Accessibility Guidelines following a
    research-focused, user-centered design methodology. Also see the
    [Silver Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/silver/).
