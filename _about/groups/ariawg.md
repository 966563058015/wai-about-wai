The mission of the Accessible Rich Internet Applications Working Group
(ARIA WG) is to develop technologies that enhance accessibility of web
content for people with disabilities. This includes continued
development of the Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)
suite of technologies and other technical specifications when needed to
bridge known gaps.
