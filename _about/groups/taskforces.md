Task Forces operate under specific Working Groups.

This page lists some active Task Forces in [WAI Working Groups](/about/groups/). Other Task Forces, including inactive
ones, are listed on each Working Group's home page.

**[Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Task Force](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/conformance-testing/)** under the [WCAG Working Group](/about/groups/agwg/)
:   Develop a framework and repository of test rules, to promote a
    unified interpretation of WCAG 2.0 among different web accessibility
    test tools. The framework will also allow the development of custom
    test rules to meet company requirements and best practices. While
    this framework will add a layer of implemention for tool developers,
    it provides more consistency and comparability of the resulting test
    rules.

[**Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/coga/) (Cognitive A11Y TF) under the [Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group](/about/groups/apa/) and the [WCAG Working Group](/about/groups/agwg/)
:   Assisting Working Groups to produce techniques, understanding, and
    guidance documents, as well as updates to existing related W3C
    material that addresses the cognitive space.

**[CSS Accessibility Task Force](/WAI/APA/task-forces/css-a11y/)** under the [Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group](/about/groups/apa/), the [Accessible Rich Internet Applications Working Group](/about/groups/ariawg/), and the [Cascading Style Sheets Working Group](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/)
:   Identify accessibility problems that can be created by use of
    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and to develop solutions.

**[Digital Publishing ARIA Task Force](http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/dpub-a11y-tf/)** under the [ARIA Working Group](/about/groups/ariawg/) and the [Digital Publishing Interest Group](https://www.w3.org/dpub/IG/) 
:   Comparing existing vocabularies, including IDPF's [EPUB Structural
    Semantic Vocabulary](http://www.idpf.org/epub/vocab/structure/) and
    ARIA [Roles](http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-1.1/roles), to create a
    recommended list of digital publishing terms allowing for clear
    interaction with assistive technologies, easy reusability, and
    native validation.

**[Low Vision Accessibility Task Force](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/low-vision-a11y-tf/)** (LVTF) under the [WCAG Working Group](/about/groups/agwg/)
:   Assisting Working Groups to address web accessibility issues
    specific to people with low vision.

[**Mobile Accessibility Task Force**](http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/mobile-a11y-tf/) under the [WCAG Working Group](/about/groups/agwg/)
:   Assisting Working Groups to produce techniques, understanding, and
    guidance documents, as well as updates to existing related W3C
    material that addresses the mobile space.
    
[**Personalization Task Force**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/task-forces/personalization/) under the [APA Working Group](https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/)
:   Personalization involves tailoring aspects of the user experience to meet the needs and preferences of the individual user.

**[Research Question Task Force](https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/task-forces/research-questions/)** under the [APA Working Group](/about/groups/apa/)
:   Identify accessibility knowledge gaps and barriers in emerging and
    future web technologies, and to identify research findings,
    researchers, and research opportunities to inform and fill those
    gaps where possible.

**[Silver Task Force](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/silver/)** under the [WCAG Working Group](/about/groups/agwg/)
:   Perform preliminary development of a new version of Accessibility
    Guidelines following a research-focused, user-centered design
    methodology to produce the most effective and flexible outcome.
    These guidelines will address the process of making content and
    functionality accessible to people with disabilities, including the
    roles of content authoring, user agent support, and authoring tool
    support. These guidelines will address current technological and
    cultural web accessibility requirements and provide a base for
    continued evolution of the guidelines.

**[Specification Accessibility Task Force](http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/Group/spec-review-tf)** under the [APA Working Group](/about/groups/apa/)

**[SVG Accessibility Task Force](http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/svg-a11y-tf/)** under the [ARIA Working Group](/about/groups/ariawg/) and the [SVG Working Group](http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/WG/)
