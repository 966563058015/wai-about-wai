## Introduction

This page highlights some of the current accessibility work in the Web Accessibility Iniaitive (WAI) and other groups in the W3C. It includes links to the group responsible for the work, so you can learn more about contributing to specific projects.

* To learn more about contributing to this work generally, see [[Participating in WAI]](/about/participating/).
* To get updates on this and other accessibility work, see [[Get WAI News]](/news/subscribe/).
* To learn about existing resources, see [[WAI Resources]](/resources/).

## Web Accessibility Guidelines and other Standards

* **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2** is in progress. The current plan is to publish the final version by June 2022. Note that these links have information that will change: [What's New in WCAG 2.2 Working Draft](/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/), [WCAG 2.2 Editor's Draft ](https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/).

* **W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0** an early draft of a few aspects of a potential new standard. It is years away from being finalized. [[WCAG 3 Introduction]](/standards-guidelines/wcag/wcag3-intro/), [About Accessibility Guidelesines Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/ag)

* **Personalization** (renaming in progress, maybe _Personalized Adaptation_) involves tailoring the user experience to meet the needs and preferences of the individual user. [[Personalization Overview]](/personalization/), [Personalization Task Force](https://www.w3.org/groups/tf/personalization-tf)

* **Spoken Pronunciation** technical standards are being developed to enable screen readers and voice assistants to pronounce words correctly. [[Pronunciation Overview]](/pronunciation/), [Spoken Pronunciation Task Force](https://www.w3.org/groups/tf/pronunciation-tf)

* **ARIA**

## Guidance for Cognitive, Low Vision, Mobile

* **Cognitive** &mdash; There are several documents being updated to better address the needs of people with cognitive and learning disabilities. See [[Cognitive Accessibility at W3C]](/cognitive/). [About COGA TF](https://www.w3.org/groups/tf/cognitive-a11y-tf)

* **Low Vision**  &mdash; We are writing guidance that goes beyong the minimums required by WCAG. It is called "supplementla guidance". Current topics cover proximity, printing, and alternative themes such as high contrast and dark mode. [About Low Vision TF](https://www.w3.org/groups/tf/low-vision-a11y-tf)

* [[Mobile Accessibility at W3C]](/standards-guidelines/mobile/)

## Accessibility User Requirements (AUR) and Emerging Technologies

Documenting the user needs of people with disabilities helps develop standards to meet those needs. It also helps designers, developers, and others better understand and meet user needs in order to support accessibility.

* **Natural Language Interface Accessibility User Requirements ("NAUR")** is a Working Draft. A natural language interface is a user interface in which the user and the system communicate via a natural (human) language. The user provides input as sentences via speech or other input, and the system generates responses as sentences delivered by speech, text, or another modality. [About  NAUR](https://www.w3.org/blog/2021/10/natural-language-interface-accessibility-user-requirements-call-for-review/), [NAUR Draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/naur), [About the APA Working Group](https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/)

* **XR Accessibility User Requirements (XAUR)** is a Working Draft. XAUR describes the needs of people with disabilities in virtual or immersive environments (XR). It includes requirements for XR to be accessible. XAUR is for designers and developers who are involved in creating XR experiences. [XAUR Draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/xaur/), [About the APA Working Group](https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/)

* **Synchronization Accessibility User Requirements (SAUR)** is a Working Draft. Synchronization of multimedia content, especially audio and video, is essential for accessible web-based communication and cooperation. To be understandable, media needs to be synchronized to very specific limits. [SAUR Draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/saur/)

* **How People with Disabilities Use the Web** helps you understand user needs broadly. We are updating this resrouce and creating videos to go along with it. [[How People with Disabilities Use the Web]](/people-use-web/), [About EOWG](/EO/)

* **Cognitive accessibility user requirements** &mdash; Updating documentation on the user needs of people with cognitive and learning disabilities is happening through the [Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force (COGA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/coga/#about).

## Teaching Accessibility

**Curricula on Web Accessibility** is a framework to build your own courses. It currently includes modules for foundations for everyone, for developers, and for designers. We are currently working on modules for content authors. [[Existing Curricula]](/curricula/), [Content Authors rough draft outline](https://github.com/w3c/wai-curricula/wiki/content-author-modules-outline), [About EOWG](/EO/)

## Testing Accessibility

**WCAG 2 Test Rules** (also known as ACT Rules) describe how to test conformance to WCAG success criteria. They are primarily for developers of evaluation tools and test methodologies. [[About WCAG 2 Test Rules]](/standards-guidelines/act/rules/about/), [Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Task Force](https://www.w3.org/groups/tf/wcag-act)

**for AUR page -- also:**

* **Media Accessibility User Requirements (MAUR)** is a published Working Group Note. This document presents the accessibility requirements users with disabilities have with respect to audio and video on the web.  [About MAUR](https://www.w3.org/blog/2015/12/media-accessibility-user-requirements-is-a-w3c-note/), [MAUR Note](https://www.w3.org/TR/media-accessibility-reqs/)

* **RTC Accessibility User Requirements (RAUR)** is a published Working Group Note. Real-time communication (RTC) provides real-time peer to peer audio, video, and data exchange directly between supported user agents. This enables instantaneous applications for video and audio calls, text chat, file exchange, screen sharing, and gaming. [RAUR Note](https://www.w3.org/TR/raur/)
