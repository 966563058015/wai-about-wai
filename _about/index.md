## World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)

The World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) commitment to lead the Web to its full potential includes promoting a high degree of usability for people with disabilities. The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) is an initiative of the W3C.

WAI develops its work through W3C's consensus-based process, involving different stakeholders in Web accessibility. These include industry, disability organizations, government, accessibility research organizations, and more.

WAI, in partnership with organizations around the world, pursues accessibility of the Web through five primary activities:

-   ensuring that core technologies of the Web support accessibility
-   developing guidelines for Web content, user agents, and authoring tools
-   facilitating development of evaluation and repair tools for accessibility
-   conducting education and outreach
-   coordinating with research and development that can affect future accessibility of the Web

## WAI Groups

WAI includes the following Working Groups and Interest Group:

-   [Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (AG WG)]({{ "/GL/" | relative_url }}) (formerly the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group)
