The World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) commitment to lead the Web to its
full potential includes promoting a high degree of usability for people
with disabilities. The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) develops its
work through W3C's consensus-based process, involving different
stakeholders in Web accessibility. These include industry, disability
organizations, government, accessibility research organizations, and
more.

WAI, in partnership with organizations around the world, pursues
accessibility of the Web through five primary activities:

-   ensuring that core technologies of the Web support accessibility
-   developing guidelines for Web content, user agents, and authoring
    tools
-   facilitating development of evaluation and repair tools for
    accessibility
-   conducting education and outreach
-   coordinating with research and development that can affect future
    accessibility of the Web
